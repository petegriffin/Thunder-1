/**
 * \brief Performs decryption based on adapter implementation.
 *
 * This method accepts encrypted data and will typically decrypt it out-of-process (for security reasons). The actual data copying is performed
 * using a memory-mapped file (for performance reasons). If the DRM system allows access to decrypted data (i.e. decrypting is not
 * performed in a TEE), the decryption is performed in-place.
 * \param session \ref OpenCDMSession instance.
 * \param buffer Gstreamer buffer containing encrypted data and related meta data. If applicable, decrypted data will be stored here after this call returns.
 * \param subSample Gstreamer buffer containing subsamples size which has been parsed from protection meta data.
 * \param subSampleCount count of subsamples
 * \param IV Gstreamer buffer containing initial vector (IV) used during decryption.
 * \param keyID Gstreamer buffer containing keyID to use for decryption
 * \return Zero on success, non-zero on error.
